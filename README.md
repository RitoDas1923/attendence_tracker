# attendence_tracker
One of the worst problems we have been facing recently in our offline college classes have been the additional time taken during the classes for attendance. Attendance for a class with upwards of 100 students can easily take upto 10 minutes. What's more is in colleges and schools where a minimum attendance criteria is enforced, it would take a teacher a lot of time to count the number of days a particular pupil was present and then find its percentage in order to find out if the pupil should be allowed to appear for examinations or not.
Well these are one of the few problems that our project Attendance Tracker aims to solve.

With our app any teacher can now take attendance digitally with all the attendance data being stored on a MongoDB database. This data is accessible by both the Teacher and any Student.
The Student can view their current attendance on our mobile app, as well as find out how many more days they need to attend in order to full-fill their minimum attendance criteria.
The Teacher can not only view the current attendance stats.
